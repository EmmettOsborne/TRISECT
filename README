# About Me

Hello! My name is Emmett Osborne! I'm a 23 year old new CS grad from Montana State University, Bozeman. 

I've been working on TRISECT on and off since mid 2022. Originally inspired by the STriDER team at RoMeLa (Virginia Tech, later RoMeLa moved to UCLA) Robotics Lab, I set off to attempt to replicate their unique gait with 1 fewer degree of freedom per leg. While I am not a Mechanical Engineer, I am at least somewhat confident that the originally troublesome mechanical challenges are now behind me, and the problem is merely a software one!

The following documentation on this project is partially from a Microcontrollers class project, so take it with a grain of salt. I intend to rewrite it into a more generalized explanation soon.

## Embedded System Description

The goal of my final project is to implement an ESP8266 as a master controller, receiving data from 7 external IMU sensors via I2C, as well as commands from a wireless transceiver to control actuation of 18 servos driven by three seperate servo drivers in order to smoothly control a tripedal robot called TRISECT (TRIpedal Integrated System for Experimental Control and Testing) in varying degrees of complex control schemes detailed below. 

Each leg of the tripedal robot is a simple two segment limb with direct drive servos at each joint. The hip joint has 2 degrees of freedom (1 180° & 1 270° actuation range) and the knee joint has one (270° actuation range). There will be an IMU sensor (MPU6050) mounted at the midpoint of each segment of each leg providing 6 axis (Accelerometer & Gyroscope) input readings during operation via an I2C bus. Each leg will have its own servo driver (PCA9685) output controlling the 6 servos on each leg (2 servos per DOF, 18 total). 

The central body of the robot houses the controller, the ESP8266, as well as a central IMU (MPU9250) providing a 9 axis (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, & Magnetometer) input data via I2C. The body houses a wireless transceiver (NRF24L01+) which will recieve commands from an external remote control. The body also houses an I2C multiplexer (TCA9548A) in order to enable communication between all sensors. (Note: The MPU6050s and the MPU9250 can only have addresses 0x68 or 0x69, necessitating the need for 4 seperate I2C busses) 

The whole system is powered by a pair of 18650 Lithium Ion batteries in series, providing 7.4V DC, stepped down to 6V DC via a voltage regulator (LM2596). Each leg also has a pair of series 18650s as power for the servos, each with their own voltage regulator (LM2596).

## Hardware Setup

Circuit Diagram Documentation can be found in planning/circuit_diagrams. Custom PCB design included.

You'll notice the boards are through hole only. I chose to do this because I was at the time going for a Minimum Viable Product and using off the shelf components and a custom through hole pcb was the fastest way to achieve that.

## Software overview

The software will have at minimum 3 modes of operation:

1.  Startup
2.  Individual Direct Control
3.  Symmetric Direct Control
4.  Advanced Control
5.  Experimental Control

The system transitions between modes based on specific commands received via the NRF24L01+ from the remote control.

- Startup: Upon system initialization, operation will begin in Startup mode. In Startup, each leg is powered, with each joint at the midpoint of it's actuation range. No servos will move from this position until switching to a different mode of operation.

- Individual Direct Control: Once switched into Individual Direct Control mode, based on specified inputs from the wireless transceiver a single joint will be under control at one time. Input from the remote control joystick will then actuate the selected joint.

- Symmetric Direct Control: Once switched into Symmetric Direct Control mode, based on specified inputs from the wireless transceiver, each joint type (Knee, Hip, Hip Pivot) will react to input from the remote control joystick. The IMU sensors will provide a feedback loop on which a PID (or similar) control scheme will enable smooth and predictable actuation.

- Advanced Control: This bonus control mode will abstract away the individual joints and joint groups, relying on inverse kinematics and an advanced PID control schema to attempt to crab walk in an ideally graceful, quick motion.

- Experimental Control: This bonus control mode is the pinnacle of this project. If achieved, the system will be capable of stepping utilizing the experimental gait initially designed and presented by the STriDER team at RoMeLa (Virginia Tech, later RoMeLa moved to UCLA). While they pioneered this gait in 2007, they never developed a system capable of performing the gait without passive dynamic locomotion. (Note: The implementation of passive dynamic locomtion was the main focus of the STriDER project. In no way am I suggesting that they failed!) I intend to implement this gait with direct drive actuation of each joint at all times. Check out the [video here!](https://youtu.be/7XsaJwKKBYo?si=tUSaFY6jGtXLBAKC "STriDER")

## Testing Procedure (Microcontrollers Project)

In order to test and verify success, at minimum the first 3 modes of operation will be demonstrated. First Startup, a stable state in which to initialize and calibrate the system. Next, Individual Direct Control, demonstrating accurate control over each unique joint. And Finally, Symmetric Direct Control, demonstrating a smooth PID (or similar) based control loop driving each leg symmetrically.

Success Criteria:

- Startup: All servos initialize at midpoints, and IMUs calibrate without errors.
- Individual Direct Control: Each joint moves accurately (±2°) to remote joystick inputs.
- Symmetric Direct Control: All joints of a type (e.g., knees) move symmetrically, with IMU-based PID (or similar) adjusting servo angles to maintain a stable standing posture for at least 10 seconds.

Demo Setup:

I'll bring the robot and controller to demonstrate mode transitions and stability on a flat surface. No extra equipment is needed.

# FAQ

- Q: Training folder empty?
- A: No, that isn't a mistake. I'm just not quite there yet! Still finalizing the software on the robot before I can begin to work on attempting RL.
- Q: Why is the Git history missing?
- A: Unfortunately the original repository I had for this project was part of a GitHub Organization which was unexpectedly deleted. Lesson learned, I should've forked it!
